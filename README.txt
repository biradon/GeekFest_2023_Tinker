We're Tinker group with 3 members:

We try to approach the specific situation where end-users facing tough situations. Have you ever been in a situation where you lost your phone somewhere and needed to borrow someone's phone to use social applications to contact someone or post any post to announce to your friends or family your situation? However, even if you can borrow someone's phone to do it, the application nowhere day does need to be verified by email or by phone number to log in, but how can you do it if you don’t have your phone?

Our solution is to balance the terms between using technology to ensure the security of data privacy and at the same time need to make sure it’s friendly to users. So that’s why TinkerFace is the way

Standing on the shoulder of AI face scan recognition and AI face scan comparison, we designed the new flow to make verification when logging in to other devices simpler with high security. Because we believe that our biometric identity is the most proof to show for the system that you are you and me are me.
